Our bot is a java maven dependency manager.

Our 3 use cases are:

1. Change which project/repo (from Github) we are monitoring
2. List the dependencies in the project we are monitoring (also lists the version and any newer versions).
3. Update one dependency to the latest version that will compile/build and pass unit tests with our project.

Our screencast is: [Screencast](http://www4.ncsu.edu/~dwrice/Videos/Service%20Screencast%20Good.mp4)

We have updated WORKSHEET.md throughout the iterations, and have tacked on the new stuff to what was already in WORKSHEET.md from the previous milestone.

Our task tracking for Service milestone is as follows:

our 3rd milestone did not contain too many tasks that were still left outstanding.
